## 10. Additional Content

Any other content that should be added to the website:

```
On the homepage, **bold** the "T" "R" "A" "C" "E" on line three so it's easier to see TRACE within the sentence text.

Delete the following team members from the website: Rigel Cierniak, Rose Guingrich, Hamza Alshamy, Mihir Uphadhyay, Mohamed Hendy, Dvija Mehta, Francesco Quinzan

Need to add a "News" page in the top navigation pane. 

At the top of each of the research sections, remove "Jan 1, 2024"

Delete all of the social media buttons at the bottom of each of the research sections.

 

```

## 11. Bug detection

Any other content that should be added to the website:

```
Doesn't seem possible from the homepage to navigate to the team's full profiles - perhaps make the icons for each team member clickable to take to their full profile page (with their photo, full bio, and links to their publications like on Umang's)

While in light mode, team members' boxes open in dark mode and are unreadable.

```
