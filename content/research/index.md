            <h3>Deployment as a Science</h3>
            <p class="research-question">How do people use AI systems around the world?</p>
            <p>Fabric is a public catalog of AI systems deployed in real-world contexts. We capture how individual and institutional oversight help integrate AI into existing workflows. We are building a community of deployers to share best practices and patterns of AI use.</p>

            <h3>Externalities of Human-AI Interaction</h3>
            <p class="research-question">What is the impact of AI use?</p>
            <p>We are building a large-scale, multi-domain study and open-source platform to track the longitudinal effects of AI use on productivity, confidence, and equity. We conduct focused evaluations within single domains and cross-cultural settings.</p>

            <h3>Affordances of AI Use</h3>
            <p class="research-question">How do people interact with AI systems?</p>
            <p>We examine how the interaction medium changes user cognition, behavior, and performance. We collect in-situ data on how users engage with AI in physical spaces to understand context-dependent behavior.</p>

            <h3>Agent Orchestration</h3>
            <p class="research-question">How do we deploy AI agents among humans?</p>
            <p>Modiste is our platform to learn policies for when the use of AI agents is appropriate, given user state, task requirements, and organizational constraints.</p>

            <p class="research-question">Bridging all initiatives with core technical research</p>
            <p>Spanning transparency & explanations, human-AI collaboration, and evaluation. We design collaboration mechanisms, develop uncertainty-aware explanations, and conduct interactive evaluations uncovering failure modes invisible to benchmarks.</p>
