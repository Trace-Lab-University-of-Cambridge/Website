## About Us

The TRACE Lab is a research group focused on building trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) systems for high-stakes settings, like healthcare, education, and public safety. We develop new algorithms and tools that support effective human-AI interaction and manage the partnership between humans and AI agents.

Drawing from machine learning, human-computer interaction, and social science, we investigate when and how AI can be trusted, integrated into decision-making, and evaluated in ecologically valid settings.

## Our Partners

We work with partners across government, industry, and civil society, including:
- Partnership on AI
- Mozilla
- RAII
- OECD

## Stay Connected
