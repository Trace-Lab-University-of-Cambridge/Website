## What is the impact of AI use?

We are building a large-scale, multi-domain study and open-source platform to track the longitudinal effects of AI use on productivity, confidence, and equity. In parallel, we conduct focused evaluations within single domains and cross-cultural settings to understand heterogeneous impacts of using AI assistance. We investigate moral development by studying how short-story reading, with and without AI mediation, shapes moral acquisition and downstream behavior.

### Key Initiatives

- **Large-Scale, Multiple Domains Study + Platform** - Tracking longitudinal effects of AI use
- **Single Domain Studies** - Focused evaluations within specific domains
- **Cross-Cultural Studies** - Understanding heterogeneous impacts across cultures
- **Externalities of Moral Acquisition** - Studying moral development after reading short stories with and without AI mediation

### Research Questions

- What are the longitudinal effects of AI use on productivity, confidence, and equity?
- How do impacts of AI assistance vary across domains and cultures?
- How does AI mediation affect moral acquisition and downstream behavior?
