## Fundamentals of Trustworthy AI

Bridging all of our initiatives is our fundamental technical research into trustworthy AI, spanning transparency, collaboration, and evaluation.

### Transparency & Explanations

Our older research showed traditional explainability techniques have had limited value in real-world deployments. In response, we developed **uncertainty-aware explanations** and **adaptive methods** to support users in practice.

### Human-AI Collaboration

We design human-AI collaboration mechanisms to:
- Improve user performance
- Incorporate **algorithmic resignation** when appropriate
- Introduce **frictions** to reduce overreliance and prevent skill atrophy

### Evaluation

Our interactive evaluation of LLMs in theorem proving uncovered failure modes invisible to benchmarks. We then aligned models via:
- Soft label collection
- Latent factor selection
- Stakeholder-informed hyperparameter tuning

### Ongoing Work

We have ongoing work in all of these areas and are actively seeking strong candidates for our degree programs in this space.
