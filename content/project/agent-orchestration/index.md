## How do we deploy AI agents among humans?

**Modiste** is our platform to learn policies for when the use of AI agents is appropriate, given user state, task requirements, and organizational constraints. We modulate access to agents by combining dynamic prices, richer objective functions, and purposeful frictions so that assistance aligns with safety, equity, and cost goals. We are extending this to treat humans as high-value information sources, designing protocols for agents to acquire information to improve performance and strengthen oversight.

### Key Initiatives

- **Modiste Platform** - Learning policies for when AI assistance is appropriate
- **Access Modulation** - Using dynamic prices, richer objectives, and frictions to align AI assistance with goals
- **Humans as Tools** - Information acquisition to improve agent performance

### Research Questions

- When is the use of AI agents appropriate given user state, task requirements, and organizational constraints?
- How can we modulate access to agents to align with safety, equity, and cost goals?
- How can agents acquire information from humans to improve performance and strengthen oversight?
