## How do people interact with AI systems?

We examine how the interaction medium, such as speech, text, or multimodal interfaces, changes user cognition, behavior, and performance. We collect in-situ data on how users engage with AI in physical spaces (e.g., art galleries) to understand context-dependent behavior. We are tracking how workplaces evolve as AI is adopted, including risks like misaligned incentives and failure modes reminiscent of the Peter Principle. We seek to build AI thought partners and investigate how LLM use surfaces new forms of harm and bias.

### Key Initiatives

- **Question the Medium** - Studying human-AI interaction across speech, text, and multimodal interfaces
- **AI in Physical Spaces** - Gathering data about how people interact with AI in spaces like art exhibits
- **Workplace Evolution** - Understanding how workplaces change upon adopting AI (e.g., Peter Principle)
- **AI Thought Partners** - Building systems that serve as effective thought partners

### Research Questions

- How does the interaction medium (speech vs. text vs. multimodal) affect user cognition and behavior?
- How do people engage with AI differently in various physical contexts?
- What are the risks of AI adoption in workplaces, including misaligned incentives?
- How does LLM use surface new forms of harm and bias?
